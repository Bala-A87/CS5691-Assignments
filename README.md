# CS5691-Assignments
Programming assignments done as part of CS5691 - Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.

## Assignments

Programming assignments in Python (Jupyter notebooks) to implement multiple (supervised) machine learning algorithms learned in class using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - naive Bayes classifier, ridge regression, logistic regression, SVM, decision tree and ensemble methods (random forest, AdaBoost). Cross-validation for hyperparameter selection was performed for the second assignment. 

1. Naive Bayes, regression and the bias-variance tradeoff
    - Binary naive Bayes classifier
    - Multi-class naive Bayes classifier
    - Bias-variance analysis for ridge regularised polynomial regression
    - Analysis of overfitting and underfitting in ridge regularised polynomial regression
    - Bayesian regression, determining the posterior distribution $W | X, Y$
2. Classification methods
    - Logistic regression
    - SVM ([sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) implementation was used)
    - Decision tree
    - Random forest
    - AdaBoost
